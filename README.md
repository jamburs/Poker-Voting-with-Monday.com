By using Monday.com, Google Client, and Github's API's, this script allows projects input into Monday.com to be voted on by the investment and operations teams. 
These votes are recorded and plotted to aid in-person discussion of priorities, and are pushed back to Monday.com through hosting the images in another GitHub repository.
